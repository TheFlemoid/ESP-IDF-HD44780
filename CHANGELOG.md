## [Released - 12FEB25]
### Added
### ESP-IDF-HD44780 v0.9
- Initial release of library.  Library has full 4-bit and 8-bit HD44780 functionality, 
  and is set up to be used as an ESP-IDF Component for arbitrary projects.  Still have
  a couple of examples to add before I call this a v1.0 release of the library.
